# Flutter template

This is a template app with an elaborated arquitecture that allow the app to grow with a clear separated layers

## Description

The app is basically designed to make two interactions with the API https://dev.s1m.ch/frontworkAPI/
The first one will give us the token during the login page and the second one is to post some fake hardcoded bartenderers in the second page.

## Arquitecture

IÂ´ve tried to separate the different layers so in the future it will be as easier as possible to manage big apps.
